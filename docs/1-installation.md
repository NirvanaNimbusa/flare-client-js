# Installation

To start catching JavaScript errors in your production environment, install the client in your project:

```
yarn add flare-client-js
```

and initialize it as early as possible in your application:

```JS
import flareClient from "flare-client";

// only launch in production, we don't want to waste your quota while you're developing.
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    flareClient.light('your-project-key');
}
```

The client will automatically catch errors that aren't caught and bubble up to the `window` object. This includes most errors in vanilla JS code that isn't wrapped in a `tryâ€¦catch` block. Errors that are caught by, for example, Axios' `catch` block, will not be reported automatically. Keep on reading to find out how to send those errors to Flare too.

## Reporting caught errors

You can also report errors in `catch` statements or error boundaries by doing the following:

```
import flareClient from "flare-client";

try {
    functionThatMightThrow();
} catch (error) {
    flareClient.report(error);
}
```

Some frameworks like React and Vue have their own way of handling errors and require some extra steps to get running. You can easily hook into these by using one of the plugins we provide: `link to framework-integrations page`.
